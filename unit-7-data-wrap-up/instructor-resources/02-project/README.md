# Final Project

First off, let's take a second to congratulate you for making it this far! We know we've packed a lot of knowledge into a relatively short time! Kudos for rocking it!

## Prompt

We'd like you to have something tangible to show for having taken this class with us, so let's use your newly acquired Pandas skills to make a data-pulling app!

#### Got Ideas?

You are free to make a website about any topic you'd like as long as it meets all the requirements listed below. If you're having trouble coming up with a topic, here are a few options to consider:

* Find a fun data set and base it on that.
* Make an app that contrasts data from your hobbies.
* Make something you think would improve your life in some way.
* Feel free to share resources and inspiration with your classmates!

## Deliverables

You must have a Pandas app in Jupyter Notebooks. You will work individually on this project, but feel free to share inspiration, resources, or cool data sets with your classmates!

### Requirements

Your assignment **must** include:

1. Data pulled from at least one data set.
   - Get creative! Tons of free data sets exist. Ask your instructor or classmates for ideas.
2. Data displayed in a minimum of two different visualizations.
    - Make the best possible choice of visualizations for the data, and be sure that they're easy to comprehend.
3. Cleaning the data — handling of null values or other potential errors in the data.
4. Core Python topics. At a minimum, this should include:
      - Dictionaries *or* sets *or* tuples.
      - `**args` *or* `kwargs` *or* `*kwargs`.
      - Basic debugging, such as a `try/except` block (only if necessary).
      - A class.
      - User input *or* reading from a file.
5. Comments, so another developer can easily see what your app does.


### Resources

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning ahead, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.
* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies or data sets you use. Most of the time there will be a tutorial you can follow! This isn't always the case, but learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of a process helps.

## Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on the rubric below.

### Rubric

| Score | Expectations |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 | Incomplete. |
| 1 | Does not meet expectations. |
| 2 | Meets expectations — good job! |
| 3 | Exceeds expectations — fantastic! |


Here's an example of how the criteria works. Let's say your assignment was to cook a pizza:

Criteria | **0** (Incomplete.) | **1** (Does not meet expectations.) | **2** (Meets expectations.) | **3** (Exceeds expectations.) |
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Crust | No crust present. Submission is just cheese and sauce on a plate. | Pizza has a crust, but it is raw. | Crust is cooked thoroughly.| Crust is golden brown and the perfect thickness.
Cheese | No cheese present. | A small sprinkle of unmelted cheese in the middle of the pie. | Cheese covers the pizza from edge to edge but is not fully melted. | Cheese is delicious, plentiful, and melted to perfection.

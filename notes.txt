lesson 1
--------
- Never talk about data types
- There's no time for command line lesson
- Bug in homework, spells HELLO WJRLD
- Homework is confusing. It doesn't spell any words, it just prints numbers, but the "hello world" aspect is forced in there. I'd rethink this completely.

Lesson 2
--------
- Truth tables are really confusing, should change the ordering here/add more resources.
- No time to go over homework or answer any questions. I ended up not able to do the Lists lesson.

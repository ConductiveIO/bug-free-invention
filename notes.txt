lesson 1
--------
- Never talk about data types
- There's no time for command line lesson
- Bug in homework, spells HELLO WJRLD
- Homework is confusing. It doesn't spell any words, it just prints numbers, but the "hello world" aspect is forced in there. I'd rethink this completely.

Lesson 2
--------
- When will we tell them what functions are?

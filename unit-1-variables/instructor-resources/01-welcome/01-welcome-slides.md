<h1>Welcome to Python Programming!</h1>

<!--

## Overview
This lesson serves as the kick-off to your Python Programming class. Whether you’re delivering this course online or in-person, in a 1-week accelerated for 10-week format, take the first hour or so of your time together to get things started on the right foot.

This lesson is designed to introduce yourself, GA, and get the students comfortable and excited to learn. Following that, there's a brief review of the pre-work.

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Define class expectations and norms.
- Understand key concepts introduced in the pre-work


## Duration
60 minutes

## Before Class: Preparation
- Update the slides that follow with specific information about you, your class, your city and your local support team.
- Take some time to consider your expectations for learners and be prepared to talk about them.
- Choose an ice breaker to run that will allow learners to get to know one another in a fun, informal, low-stakes way. We have a list [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a91IqhzijI_3EqU-trJbZN4vDDSU0rXqgIrqGwsWM7I/edit) of fun activities - and other good slides to copy - for the students for you to choose from. And if you have some good ones, feel free to share your ideas with us!
- Before class, review completion data to understand how far your learners have progressed through the myGA prework.
-- If most of your learners have completed all of the prework, you should be able to breeze through this lesson very quickly.
-- If most of your learners have not completed all of the prework, you might want to spend more time on this lesson and reduce your timings for the rest of the lessons in Unit 1.

- At the end of the 9th week, you’ll choose a final project focus.
- During the 10th week in class, you’ll build an application in Python based on your project focus area.
- At the end of the 10th week, you’ll demo your project for the class.

<aside class="notes">

## Okay - Let's get to it! Prework Review

- Did everyone complete it?

- Let's review it!

We learned:
- What programming is
- What Python is
- What pseudocode is
- What else?


<aside class="notes">

1 MINUTE

**Teaching Tips**:

- There are slides on each concept following this.
- These are basic concepts to you, but potentially brand new to some students. Take your time to make sure everyone understands them.

</aside>

---

## Programming and Programming Languages

**Programming**:
- Writing step-by-step instructions in a way a computer can understand.

**Programming Languages**

- How we can give computers instructions.
- There are thousands! But we're learning **Python**.
- Specifically, Python 3.

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- On this and all below, don't just read the slides. Add in your own interpretation.

</aside>

---

## Key Features of Python

- It's simple.
- It's versatile.
- It's always improving.
- It's popular!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- On this and all below, don't just read the slides. Add in your own experience and thoughts.

</aside>

---

## When to Use Python

- Putting up websites/prototypes.
- Scraping the web.
- Analyzing data.
- Building robots.
- Curing Cancer.

Most use cases!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside>

---

## When NOT to Use Python

Other programming languages exist - Python isn't **ideal** for everything!

- Mobile apps
- Huge **Monolithic** programs
  - Python is interpreted - the computer reads it as it goes.
  - Other programming languages are read in advance!
- When Speed Really Matters
  - Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can slow things down

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside>

---

## Pseudocode

- Writing out your program in simple, step-by-step instructions using plain English.
- Not a programming language!
- Something you should always do.

```
First, open the fridge.
Then, take out the cheese.
Then, close the fridge.
```

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Ask students what they think pseudocode is good for; then tell them.
- (e.g. to make sure you don't miss a step)

</aside>


---

## Group Exercise: Programming in Pseudocode

Let's write pseudocode that gives instructions on how to make your favorite cocktail (or coffee or tea or bowl of cereal, it doesn't really matter).

Include every step required. Remember, computers are very literal!


<aside class="notes">

5 MINUTES

**Teaching Tips**:

- Feel free to change the example to some other simple task.
- Write on the board, here. Come up with nothing yourself!
- Encourage students to come up with the steps, and write them as students come up with them.
- You should end up with something like:
- "Raise arm"
- "Open hand; keep fingers together"
- "Wait for the other person to raise their arm and open their hand."
- "Swing your arm forward to slap their raised open hand with yours."
- "Lower your arm again."

</aside>



---

## Comments

- Programmer notes in code.
- The computer ignores them.
- Used to elucidate complex portions of code
  - Always ask yourself, is the comment necessary, or is the code unclear?

```python
# This is a comment!
```


<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Ask students what they think comments are good for; then tell them.
- (e.g. for your pseudocode; so others know what your program does; so you on Monday morning still know!).

</aside>


---

## Our First Line of Code


```python
print("Hello")
```


<aside class="notes">

**Teaching Tips**:
- Ask students what they think this does. If you deem it necessary, open a repl.it and demo it.

## Q&A and Summary

Any other questions?

Let's do it!!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Check to see if there  are any lingering questions on the pre-work.
- Mention that next up, we'll explore something new in Python - variables.

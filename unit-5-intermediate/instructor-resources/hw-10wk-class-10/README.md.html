<h1>Python Modules, Packages, and APIs: Practice Problems, Part 2</h1>
<p>In this homework, you’re going to write code for the second of the two challenge problems. This code will continue off your code from the previous homework.</p>
<p>You will practice these programming concepts we’ve covered in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including and using modules and packages.</li>
<li>Using data from APIs.</li>
<li>Reading documentation for modules and APIs.</li>
</ul>

<section id="deliverables" class="level2">
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>This homework is the second of a two-part code challenge, plus a bonus challenge. It is a little different than the other homeworks because this assignment will build on the code from Part 1, the previous homework. For your solution here, you can directly edit the <code>solution.py</code> file from the previous assignment.</p>
<p><em>Reminder: On your laptop, you can run the file from your command line with the following:</em></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1">python solution.py</a></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Make sure you are printing something out with the <code>print</code> statement. Otherwise, you won’t see any output from running your program!</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="requirements" class="level2">
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>By the end of this, you should have: * A file called <code>solution.py</code> with your combined code from Parts 1 and 2 (and, if you attempted it, the bonus portion).</p>

<h2>Problem 1: Geo Cody</h2>
<p>You already have the solution to this section from the previous homework. As a reminder, you put several destinations into a list of strings called <code>destinations</code>. Then, you imported the the <a href="https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/providers/ArcGIS.html#geocoding">geocoder module</a> and used it to translate each landmark into latitude-longitude coordinates. You looped through the list and printed each location’s latitude and longitude, then used <code>arcgis</code> to translate the places to coordinates.</p>
<p>Your code should currently have this functionality:</p>

<h2>Problem 2: Heather Weather</h2>
<section id="skill-youre-practicing-calling-an-api." class="level3">
<h3>Skill you’re practicing: Calling an API.</h3>
<p>Cody is satisfied by geolocating his landmarks, but Heather wants to take it one step further and get the current weather at each location. Help Heather with some code that calls an API to get current weather based on latitude-longitude coordinates. Take Cody’s code from Problem 1 and add an API call to <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/register">Dark Sky API</a>. &gt; Note: You will need to register an email address to get an API key, but it is free to use.</p>
<section id="directions-for-dark-sky-api" class="level4">
<h4>Directions for Dark Sky API</h4>
<p>When you first log in to the Dark Sky API site, you will see your personal API key, as well as an example of how to use that key to make a call to the API with latitude and longitude coordinates. You can click on this sample call to see what it returns.</p>
<p>The data is in a form called <code>JSON</code>, which is basically a big object. You can see in your web browser what that object looks like. Unless you have a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en">JSON prettify plug-in</a>, it will probably look like a huge mess of data and curly braces. That’s OK! Most importantly, the data we are getting includes a field called <code>currently</code>, which includes subfields <code>summary</code> and <code>temperature</code>, which together give us a pretty good idea of how we should dress for the weather.</p>
</section>
<section id="calling-an-api" class="level4">
<h4>Calling an API</h4>
<p>We’ll be using the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#module-requests">requests module</a> to call the Dark Sky API. Make sure to <code>import requests</code> at the top of your program.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> In the API results, you are accessing an object called <code>currently</code>, which has properties called <code>temperature</code> and <code>summary</code>. Therefore, you can access those fields like so: <code>result[&quot;currently&quot;][&quot;summary&quot;]</code>.</p>
